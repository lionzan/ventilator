# parametric ventilator design for use in low-resources situations
A simple COVID-19 ventilator hackable with limited resources and only few off the shelf technology components.

I designed and built this simple ventilator when worried that one family member could have caught COVID-19 and that there would not be enough resources in hospitals to take care for them.

Fortunately no-one caught COVID-19 at home, but I completed the prototype and a draft design so that the project could be used in situations of extreme lack of resources, so without the magics of 3D pronting or laser cutting.

Only a few off-the shelf technological components are needed, whereas the box and most of the mechanism can be done out of any type of sheet material available (plastic, metal, wood). I am totally aware that some materials are not indicated for a device like this, namely wood, but in emergency cases anything will do.

Obviously the design is not "approved" in any sense, nor it pretends to be a "medical device". It is intended to be used as the basis for improvements on the design and to be used under medical control and responsibility in all those cases in which a better designed product would not be available.

A parametric design of the ventilator is shared, where all the parameters desribing it can be changed, including the exact dimensions of the Ambu bag used and the thickness of the sheet material used.
