# Construction Plans and Parameters

The draft construction plans are available on Fusion360: [Parametric Low Tech Ventilator](https://a360.co/2zf8yhR)

All main measures are parametric, so to be able to adapt the design to different bag sizes, different sheet thickness, different motors and so on.

The main parameters are the following:

Bag - CRITICAL
- bag diameter
- length between inlet section and outlet section
- inlet diameter
- outlet diameter
- inlet section length
- outlet section length

Sheet material - CRITICAL
- Sheet thickness

Stepper motor
- motor side length (typically 1.7in. and 2.3in respectively for NEMA17 and NEMA23)
- motor heigth
- motor axle length

Shaft motor coupling
- diameter
- length
- motor axle depth
- threaded bar side depth

Mechanical or IR switches
- thickness
- width
