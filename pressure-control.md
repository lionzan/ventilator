# Pressure control

A minimum requirement for such a device by the UK agency MHRA is that inspiration pressure can be controlled and used in a feedback loop to regulate the speed of compression of the Ambu bag.

I have not installed any pressure measuring device yet. 
- One possible solution is to use a pressure sensor in the outlet pipe of the ventilator
- Another is to measure the force with which the bag i sbeing depressed and infer the pressure in the outlet pipe.
